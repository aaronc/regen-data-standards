# Regen Data Standards

This repository contains data standards for Regen Network.

Currently, there are two example taxonomies that can be managed in the following directories:
* Ecosystems: [/src/conent/ecosystem](./src/content/ecosystem)
* Impacts: [/src/conent/ecosystem](./src/content/ecosystem)

To add new elements to the taxonomy please follow the example files in the respective directories
making sure that each element has a `title` and `image` and some descriptive text written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org).
For example:

```markdown
---
title: The Title of the Element
image: ./someimage.svg
---

Write the description of the element here. You can use Markdown formatting if you like
```
