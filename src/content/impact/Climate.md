# Climate

Climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average weather conditions, or in the distribution of weather around the average conditions. Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have been identified as primary causes of ongoing climate change, often referred to as global warming. These activities include the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Climate change has significant impacts on human societies and natural ecosystems, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and changes in the distribution of species.
