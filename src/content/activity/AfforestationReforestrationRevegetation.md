Afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation are the practice of planting trees and other vegetation in areas where they have been removed. These practices are critical components of the global carbon cycle, and they are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. They are also major drivers of deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. Afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation are key components of the global food system, and they are essential for the production of food, feed, and fiber for human consumption.
