# Ecosystem Taxonomy

The ecosystem taxonomy is a hierarchical classification of the different types of ecosystems that exist on Earth. It is a way to organize and categorize the diversity of ecosystems based on their characteristics and the species that inhabit them. The ecosystem taxonomy is an important tool for ecologists and conservationists to understand the different types of ecosystems and the species that depend on them. It can also help to identify areas that are in need of conservation and protection.
