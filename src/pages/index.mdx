# Regen Data Standards

Regen Network is a global community and platform focused on ecological regeneration and the development of a new ecological economy. We are building a global community of developers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders to create a new ecosystem of ecological data and tools. We are developing a set of open-source data standards and tools to enable the global community to collect, verify, and analyze ecological data. Our goal is to create a new global ecological data commons that will enable the world to understand and regenerate the ecological systems that support life on Earth.
